<h3>Approach Taken</h3>
<h2>
<p>
  Prior to any site design, I began with potential user stories:
  <ul>
    <li>I dreamed that I was flying and I want to find out what that means.</li> 
    <li>I had a confusing dream and Iâ€™m curious to know if the images are predicting something in my life.</li>
    <li>I forget my dreams quickly and I want an easy place to write down notes when I wake up, so I can remember them.</li>
    <li>I want to be able to keep track of when and what I dreamed over time.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<p>
  With these ideas in mind, I used the <a href="https://balsamiq.com/">Balsalmic</a> wireframing tool, to create several site pages mockups. The wireframes are viewable <a href="https://github.com/bethburger42/dreamember/tree/master/wireframes">HERE</a>.
</p>
<p>
  My first step was to build the site user authentication for signing up and logging into the website. I then built the functionality for recording and displaying dreams. Once these models were working correctly, I tied the users and dreams together in the database, which would allowed users to create and display all of their individual dreams. During the development of the member area, I built out the pages using the bootstrap framework for consistent design. When the member area was complete, I turned my focus to the dream analyis portion of the website. I initially did some data scraping, then decided to create the functionality for entering words and definitions via the site. For increased visual appeal, I installed the TubularJS video player to integrate a streaming background image for the website.
</p>

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<h2>
<ul>
  <li>The TubularJS video player works in Internet Explorer and Safari but loads sporadically in Chrome.</li>
  <li>The functionality for updating a Dream object has been removed temporarily, as it was working incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
